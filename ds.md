## Authorization Parameters

Each REST API request must contain identication and authorization parameters.

Some REST APIs may function without these authorization parameters, however, when that occurs, these calls are treated as

client-side calls and all client-side rate limits will apply. In order to not reach client-side IP rate limits that may impact your

implementation when using server-to-server REST calls, it is Recommended Best Practice to always use an application key and

secret or a bearer token when sending requests. A non-exhaustive list of REST APIs that this may apply to are as follows:

```
accounts.login
```
```
socialize.login
```
```
accounts.notifyLogin
```
```
socialize.notifyLogin
```
```
accounts.nalizeRegistration
```
```
accounts.linkAccounts
```
Please refer to the Authorization Parameters section for details.

## Sample Requests

####  Note

```
Internal elds, are returned only in the accounts.search and the accounts.getAccountInfo REST API server-side calls, with the
proper parameters and group permissions.
```
####  Note

```
As of January 31, 2023, you may no longer use a Partner Secret as a valid authentication method for requests to SAP Customer
Data Cloud servers.
```
####  Note

```
In the following code examples, all references to secret or secretKey are referring to the secret that corresponds to the
userKey (Application key) provided in the request, and NOT to your Partner secret located in the SAP Customer Data Cloud
Dashboard.
```

```
password JSON The user's Site account password details. Contains the
following properties:
```
```
compoundHashedPassword - String - A string
in which a user's password hash as well as the
hashing algorithm and various algorithm
settings are encoded. Such a compound string
packs all information that would otherwise
need to be passed through the HashAlgorithm,
HashSalt and HashRounds parameters. We
currently support two formats, to some extent:
Modular Crypt Format (MCF) strings typically
start with a "$...$" pattern. These strings are
```

Required Name Type Description

```
typically used by PHP and Python-based user
management platforms.
```
```
hashedPassword - String - The user's
password, hashed using the algorithm dened
by the HashAlgorithm parameter using
BASE64 encoding. The max number of hash
bits is 512. If compoundHashedPassword is not
passed, this parameter is required.
```
```
hashSettings - JSON - Password settings
```
```
algorithm - String - The hash algorithm
used to encrypt the password. The
supported hash algorithms are:"md5",
"sha1", "sha1_hashbytes", "sha256",
"sha512", "sha512Hexa",
"md5_double_salted", "md5_crypt",
"bcrypt", "pbkdf2", "pbkdf2_sha256",
"pbkdf2_sha512", "drupal",
"symphony2", and "sap_abap".
```
####  Note

```
You must avoid double encoding with your
hashing. If your hashes are already hex-
encoded, you should convert them to
BASE64-encoding, not perform an
additional BASE64-encoding to the hex-
encoded hashes.
```
####  Note

```
The HashedAlgorithm will
not be accepted if a
compoundHashedPassword
is set. You will typically want
to pass md5-crypt, bcrypt
and drupal password
hashes using their
compoundHashedPassword
representation. You should
specify these algorithms
only if your user
management system stored
the raw form of these
password hashes (as byte
arrays). Be wary of passing
existing base64-encoded
hashes to hashedPassword.
These algorithms typically
string-encode their hashes
using non-standard (MIME)
base64 encodings.
```
```
For the sap_abap password
algorithm, only the
```

Required Name Type Description

```
salt - String - The BASE64 encoded
value of the salt. If HashFormat is
specied and it contains "$salt" ->
HashSalt is a required parameter and
should be clear text, not BASE64-
encoded. The max number of salt bits
is 1024.
```
```
rounds - Integer - Species the
number of iterations to perform the
hashing. The default value is 1, i.e., one
iteration of hashing. If HashAlgorithm
is "bcrypt" then this value must be a
power of two.
```
```
format - String - A template describing
how to merge the clear-text password
that is entered by the user with a salt.
The string must contain "$password",
which will be replaced with the clear-
text password. It may also contain
"$salt", which will be replaced with
whatever value you passed to the
HashSalt parameter (or you can pass
the salt directly in the template and
omit the HashSalt parameter. For
example, Wikipedia hashes passwords
that include a constant salt
("wikipedia") along with a per-user
random salt, as per this template:
"wikipedia$salt$password".
```
```
binaryFormat - String - A template
describing how to merge the clear-text
password that is entered by the user
with an optional salt, and what binary
conversion to perform. This parameter
is similar to HashFormat , but the
difference is that HashFormat works on
top of strings and then implicitly
converts the result into a bytes array
using UTF-8, and HashBinaryFormat ,
on the other hand, uses whatever
encoding is explicitly specied.
```
```
URL - String - The URL to the remote
custom hash algorithm service, used
only if the password hash algorithm is
custom.
```
```
secretQuestionAndAnswer - JSON
```
```
secretQuestion - String - The secret
question that can be used for
verication. This parameter is required
```
```
hashedPassword is
required.
```

Required Name Type Description

```
if specied so in the site's
requireSecurityQuestion Policy.
```
```
secretAnswer - String - The answer to
the secret question. This parameter is
required if specied so in the site's
requireSecurityQuestion Policy.
```
```
preferences JSON The preferences object that contains all the existing
consents for the user.
```
```
prole JSON The user's prole information. The object may include
site's custom elds in addition to reserved eld names
(as dened in the Prole object). Gigya validates that
the prole elds meet the requirements that are
dened in the Schema.
```
```
registered DateTime The UTC time when the isRegistered parameter was
set to true in ISO 8601 format, e.g., "2019-07-
16T19:20:30Z".
```
```
regSource string A string representing the source (URL) of the
registration.
```
```
subscriptions JSON object The user's subscriptions information. The object
includes the user's subscriptions. Gigya validates that
the subscriptions elds meet the requirements that
are dened in the Schema.
```
```
communications JSON object The user's communication information. The object
includes information on the user's communication
topics.
```
```
veried DateTime The UTC time when the isVeried parameter was set
to true in ISO 8601 format, e.g., "2019-07-
16T19:20:30Z".
```
```
lang string The language set for consent, if one is provided.
```
```
providerSessions JSON The user's providerSessions information.
```
```
format string Determines the format of the response.
```
```
json (default)
```
```
context string/JSON This parameter may be used to pass data through the
current method and return it, unchanged, within the
response.
```
```
ignoreInterruptions Boolean This may be used in some cases to suppress logic
applied by the Web SDK, such as automatic opening of
screens (e.g., in a registration completion scenario).
This parameter may not be used with REST APIs.
```
```
httpStatusCodes Boolean The default value of this parameter is false, which
means that the HTTP status code in SAP Customer
Data Cloud's response is always 200 (OK), even if an
error occurs. The error code and message is given
within the response data (see below). If this parameter
```

```
Required Name Type Description

is set to true, the HTTP status code in SAP Customer
Data Cloud's response would reect an error, if one
occurred.

## Authorization Parameters

Each REST API request must contain identication and authorization parameters.

Some REST APIs may function without these authorization parameters, however, when that occurs, these calls are treated as

client-side calls and all client-side rate limits will apply. In order to not reach client-side IP rate limits that may impact your

implementation when using server-to-server REST calls, it is Recommended Best Practice to always use an application key and

secret or a bearer token when sending requests. A non-exhaustive list of REST APIs that this may apply to are as follows:

```
accounts.login
```
```
socialize.login
```
```
accounts.notifyLogin
```
```
socialize.notifyLogin
```
```
accounts.nalizeRegistration
```

```
accounts.linkAccounts
```
Please refer to the Authorization Parameters section for details.

## JSON Examples

####  Note

```
As of January 31, 2023, you may no longer use a Partner Secret as a valid authentication method for requests to SAP Customer
Data Cloud servers.

```
####  Note


## Response Example

## Example for HashBinaryFormat

As explained in the Parameters table, the HashBinaryFormat parameter may contain these tokens:

```
$password:<encoding>
```
```
$salt:<encoding>
```
```
$0x<hex string>
```
The <encoding> can be one of the following: hex, base64, utf8, utf16, or utf32.

Let's assume the following password is hashed: "Gigya<salt>_<password>Gigya", where the surrounding "Gigya" and delimiting

"_" is ASCII-encoded, the <salt> is parsed from base64, and the password is encoded to UTF16.

In this case we need to import a user account using:

Where:

```
$0x4769677961 represents the ASCII bytes for "Gigya" in hex form (refer to an ASCII table).
```
```
$salt:base64 is substituted with the bytes array resulting from base64 decoding the salt, provided during the account
import (which must be a valid base64 string in this case).
```
```
$0x5F represents the delimiting "_".
```
```
$password:utf16 is substituted with the bytes array resulting from encoding the provided text password into UTF-16.
```
## Additional Information

#### Important Notes

Best Practices

```
If you are performing the import with IdentitySync (IDX), use the dedicated component
datasource.write.gigya.importAccount, and not any other component such as write.gigya.generic or record.evaluate,
since the dedicated component better handles requests rate and responses.
```
```
A eld that does not contain data will not appear in the response.
```
###### {

```
"statusCode": 200,
"errorCode": 0,
"statusReason": "OK",
"callId": "3353d2fbac894289977c102298df60d1",
"time": "2015-03-22T11:42:25.943Z",
"identityConflicts": [{
"provider": "facebook",
"providerUID": "1234"
}
]
}
```
```
HashBinaryFormat="$0x4769677961$salt:base64$0x5F$password:utf16$0x4769677961 HashSalt="<base64 str
```

```
Avoid using the same UID for numerous accounts in the same IdentitySync import job: Since calls to Gigya are done in
parallel, the order of the accounts in the import is not guaranteed. Several executions with the same UID may cause data
mismatch and account corruption.
```
```
When importing a large batch, r st test the import with a smaller batch of records. This should expose common data errors
that can be corrected before importing the larger set.
```
```
Each imported le should have about 200K accounts at most, to make it easier to follow and monitor the import progress.
```
```
If data is not provided - it will not be set. An exception for that rule is groups of elds which go together: if data exists in one
of the elds, the whole group will be affected. For example, if a loginID object for an existing account includes a username
(and other loginID elds are empty), and the import of that account includes a loginID email (and other loginID elds are
empty), the existing username will be deleted and the email written.
```
```
When email policies have are active to send any automated emails, e.g. New User Welcome or Email Veric ation, no emails
will be sent to imported user. For more information, see automated email policies.
```
Emphases for IdentitySync Data Flows

```
Import account and reset password:
```
```
In the imported account, make sure a veried email exists so there will be an address to send the email to.
```
```
Copy data between sites:
```
```
IdentitySync has built-in templates for the whole process.
```
```
Search API does not return all of the account data (subscriptions and password will not be returned). To ll the gap -
getAccountInfo can be used (datasource.read.gigya.account).
```
```
Secret questions and answers cannot be copied from site to site.
```
UID Rate Limit

```
The API has a mechanism to block multiple calls with the same UID that happen in a short time period. The allowed rate
limit is no more than 5 calls for the same UID in 1 minute.
```
#### Webhooks

Only the Subscription updated Webhook or Account progressed webhooks may be red when importing a full account. This will

happen only for existing accounts if a subscription is changed or a new subscription recorded or if a lite account was progressed to

a full account. No other webhooks will re when using this API.

#### Federation

Importing of SAML and/or OIDC identities are not supported.

#### Troubleshooting

```
Error Code Message Reason
```
```
400003 Unique identier exists. User already exists.
```
```
400006 Invalid parameter value Invalid parameter value.
```
```
503001 Service unavailable for this operation Too many calls were done with the same
account UID within a specic time period.
```
Properties passed to the API that are not valid or supported property names will be ignored and will not be imported. When an

import succeeds with non-imported properties, a list of the rst few failed properties will be returned in the response.

## accounts.search REST


Searches and retrieves data from SAP Customer Data Cloud's Accounts Storage.

### Description

Searches and retrieves data from SAP Customer Data Cloud's Accounts Storage using an SQL-like query. SQL queries are

converted intoSAP Customer Data Cloud's proprietary query language. SQL injection attacks are not possible because queries are

both created by the customer and then converted by SAP Customer Data Cloud.

Example queries and responses can be viewed at accounts.search examples.

## Query Syntax Specication

The SAP Customer Data Cloud queries use the same syntax rules as SQL, however not all standard SQL key words are available.

```
When querying for string values, value must be wrapped in double quotes. for example, SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE
name = "John Doe".
```
```
When querying for Integer (and other non-textual elds) values, value must not be wrapped in quotes. For example, SELECT
* FROM accounts WHERE age = 42.
```
```
Unsupported SQL syntax in the query string (for example, HAVING) will produce an error.
```
```
The query string clauses must be ordered in the following way*:
```
```
. Select clause
```
```
. From clause
```
```
. Where clause
```
```
. Filter clause
```
```
. Order By clause
```
```
. Start clause Or/And Limit clause
```
```
*Queries ordered differently will produce an error.
```
```
For example:
```
```
SELECT *, prole .birthYear FROM accounts ORDER BY prole .birthYear LIMIT 5 - is a valid query
```
```
SELECT *, prole .birthYear FROM accounts LIMIT 5 ORDER BY prole .birthYear - will produce an error
```
```
Encrypted elds are decrypted during searches but comparison operators (>, >=, <, <=) and regex expressions are not
available on these elds. The Contains keyword can be used for case-insensitive searches on encrypted elds but does not
support partial strings. Usernames, emails, friends' names and friends' emails are encrypted by default, additional elds
may be set as encrypted by the site.
```
```
Deleted accounts do not appear in queries.
```
```
Query examples can be generated and query commands tested using the Identity Query Tool on the SAP Customer Data
Cloud's website: After signing in, go to Reports User Identities Identity Query Tool or click here.
```
select - The "select" statement accepts a comma separated list of elds or objects to retrieve. Acceptable values for this

statement are:

```
Field names, specifying the complete path, i.e. data.album.photo.photoTitle_t, prole .r stName. Specifying partial elds
names (data.album) will return all the elds in the path.
```
####  Caution

```
A short delay is possible between the writing of account data and its availability in queries (an average delay of 1 second, and a
possible maximum of 30 seconds).
```

```
Object names, specifying an object type, i.e., prole r eturns all the elds in the Prole object.
```
```
Partial eld names (elds that contain only a part of the path to sub-objects, i.e., data.album) - will retrieve everything
below that path.
```
```
* - will retrieve every eld in the schema.
```
```
count(*) - if the data source is accounts, returns the number of accounts. If the data source is an object type, returns the
number of objects in the data store. The result is given in the response as a single value inside the "data" eld.
```
```
as - create an alias (temporary title) for the returned object or eld. 'SELECT prole .r stName AS contactName...' will
return a eld inside the prole obj called contactName containing the values of prole .r stName. Example:
```
```
sum(), min(), max(), avg(), sum_of_squares(), variance(), std() - mathematical functions, must all be performed on the
same numeric eld. Fields with null values will be ignored.
```
```
The name of the eld on which the function is to be performed must be entered in the brackets. For example: 'SELECT
min(prole .age) FROM accounts'.
```
```
sum - provides a total for the eld in the brackets.
```
```
min/max - minimum/maximum value for the eld. If no values are found, min returns "innity" and max will return "-
innity".
```
```
avg - average value of the eld.
```
```
variance - the extent that the eld's values vary.
```
```
std - standard deviation, the likelihood that values vary.
```
from - Name of the data source. Only one data source is supported. Account and IDS queries must state "FROM accounts"

(accounts.search or IDS.search). Data will be retrieved from the Prole object and/or the user dened data object in the user

accounts.

where - The "where" clause denes conditions for selecting items from the collection. Supported operators:

```
// Query:
SELECT profile.firstName AS contactName FROM accounts
```
```
// Returns
{
"results": [
{
"profile": {
"contactName": "Eric"
}
},
{
"profile": {
"contactName": "Igor"
}
},
{

> , >=, <, <= , = , != - the left operand must be a data eld name (with a proper suffix letter) and the right operand must be a
constant of the same type as the eld. For example: "WHERE prole .age >= 18 ".

Only = and != can be used with encrypted elds.

*Note: The "=" operand is case sensitive.
```
```
and , or
```
```
contains, not contains - may be used only on text (string) elds and arrays.
```
```
Text (string) elds - supports standard full text search capabilities. Contains is case sensitive, except when used on
encrypted elds. The left operand must be a text eld name and the right operand must be a constant string. You
can search for a specic word within the string, for example: 'WHERE data.about_t CONTAINS "music" '.
Underscores are treated as separators between words.
```
```
If you want to perform a search on an encrypted eld, you must enter the full string. Encrypted elds include the
elds you encrypted and also elds that the SAP Customer Data Cloud encrypts.
```
```
Arrays - the left operand must be an array eld name and the right operand must be a constant of the same type as
the array values. The array eld name must have a suffix denoting the type of the arrays values. For example:
'WHERE data.hobbies_s CONTAINS "swimming" '.
```
```
Note: You can only search words that are part of a sentence, you can't search for parts of a word.
```
```
in() - only retrieve items if the eld contains one of the list values. For example: 'SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE
prole .r stName IN ("Frank", "Dean", "Sammy")' will return users with the specied rst names.
```
```
is null , is not null
```
```
not
```
```
regex ('<regex-pattern>') - denes a search term using regex formatting. The regex syntax can be found in: Regular
Expression Language Reference. Regex patterns can't be used on encrypted elds.
```
order by - The "order by" clause species a list of elds by which to sort the result objects. You can not use ORDER BY on

encrypted elds.

limit - Using the "LIMIT" clause, you may specify the maximum number of returned result objects. If not specied, the default is

300. The maximum number of results that will be returned is 10000 ; setting a limit higher than 10000 will have no affect on

number of results. If the search is sent with openCursor = true, LIMIT will set the batch size. LIMIT must be the last item in the

query.

start - The "start" clause (not an SQL standard clause) may be used for paging. The clause species the start index from which to

return result objects. The maximum start value accepted is 5000.

The 'select - from - where - order by' query creates an (internal) indexed list of objects. By using the start and limit clauses, you will

receive a subset of this list, starting with the start index and ending with start+limit index.

Notes:

```
When implementing paging, there is no guarantee against duplications or that recently added data will show up in the
query results.
```
```
start can't be used with openCursor.
```
#### Query Optimization

Below are a few points to note regarding query optimization:

```
. Query execution is based on clause position and is executed from left to right.
```
```
. Place clauses that have the greatest impact on records returned at the beginning of your SQL statement. For example, to
retrieve a list of male users over the age of 25:
```

```
This is because lt ering rst by gender automatically reduces the result set by half, so the server only needs to run the next
lt er on half of the overall population.
```
```
. A NOT clause (NOT or !) is executed on a single statement immediately to it's right, after analyzing the statement. A single
statement can hold several conditions inside parentheses.
```
```
. Date ranges are calculated much more efficiently using a timestamp eld rather than a date eld.
```
```
. Use of regex is computationally intensive and can signicantly increase response time.
```
```
. AND clauses take precedence over OR clauses (i.e., AND clauses are executed before OR clauses).
```
```
. Use parentheses to modify default precedence (for example, to execute an OR operation before an AND operation).
```
#### Pagination

When running long queries (>5,000 records returned), it's best practice to paginate your results using cursors. If you do not use

cursors, results are limited to a total of 5,000 records per query (not just per page).

To use cursors, during the rst request, pass query=<query to execute> and openCursor=true. The response will include the

nextCursorId eld, containing a cursor ID to be used in the next request. On subsequent requests, pass cursorId=<last response's

nextCursorId> and do not submit the query again. The absence of the nextCursorId eld in a response indicates the end of the

result set.

## Request URL

##### https://accounts.<data-center>/accounts.search

Where <data-center> is:

##### us1.gigya.com - For the US data center.

##### eu1.gigya.com - For the European data center.

##### au1.gigya.com - For the Australian data center.

##### eu2.gigya.com - For the European Azure data center.

##### cn1.sapcdm.cn - For the Chinese data center.

##### global.gigya.com - For all Global site groups.

If you are not sure of your site's data center, see Finding Your Data Center.

Note: Use a POST request rather than GET if you are using a direct REST call.

## Parameters

```
Required Name Type Description
```
```
query string An SQL-like query specifying
the data to retrieve. Refer to the
Query language specication
```
```
SELECT * FROM accounts where profile.gender="m" AND profile.age > 25
```
####  Note

```
When using openCursor, you can't use 'START'.
```

Required Name Type Description

```
section above. When using
cursors, this parameter should
only be sent with the initial
request and omitted from
subsequent requests. *When
using querySig the openCursor
property is not supported.
openCursor is only supported
in server-to-server calls that
include a userKey and secret.
```
The following parameters are Required only when calling the search method from client side (i.e., Mobile SDKs):

```
querySig string An HMAC_SHA1 signature
proving that the search call is in
fact coming from your client
application, in order to prevent
fraud. Follow the instructions in
Constructing a Signature using
the following base-string: query
+ "_" + expTime.
```
```
expTime string The GMT time when the
signature, provided in the
UIDSig parameter, should
expire. The expected format is
the Unix time format including
milliseconds (i.e., the number of
seconds since Jan. 1st 1970 *
1000). SAP Customer Data
Cloud checks the time when the
search request is received. If the
time succeeds expTime, the
request is considered forged.
```
```
openCursor Boolean When set to true, the search
response will include, in
addition to the rst page,
another eld named
nextCursorId, which is used to
fetch the next batch of results.
This parameter should only be
used on the rst request and
later should be removed from
the request. When openCursor
is active, the Limit clause sets
the number of results returned
in the batch and should not be
larger than 1000 (one
thousand).
```
```
Notes:
```
```
When using a cursor
with a Limit set, the
number of results in a
batch is not guaranteed.
```

Required Name Type Description

```
openCursor is not
supported when using
querySig and can only
be used in server-to-
server calls that include
a userKey and secret.
```
```
cursorId string The cursor ID that contains the
nextCursorId value received in
the rst search call.
```
```
Notes:
```
```
You can't pass both
cursorId and query on
the same request -
cursorId brings the next
page for the search for
which it was opened.
Also, the time between
search requests using a
cursorId must not
exceed 5 minutes (300
seconds).
```
```
Each request should
contain a different
cursorId obtained from
the response of the
previous request (not
the rst) using the
nextCursorId eld. The
exception to this rule is
when a request fails or
when a particular result
set needs to be resent;
in this case, resend the
same cursorID (as long
as it has not expired) to
receive its associated
result set.
```
```
timeout integer The timeout for the request (in
milliseconds). Default value is
20000 (20 seconds). Maximum
allowed value is 60000 (60
seconds).
```

Required Name Type Description

```
restrictedQuery string An SQL-like query specifying
the data to retrieve. When using
this parameter, the query
specied must meet the regex
criteria dened for the user
making this call.
When using restrictedQuery, an
ACL must exist with a regex
limiting the allowValues for this
parameter.
```
```
accountTypes string The type of account to retrieve:
full or lite. Acceptable values:
```
```
full (the default value)
```
```
lite
```
```
full,lite
```
```
format string Determines the format of the
response.
```
```
json (default)
```
```
context string/JSON This parameter may be used to
pass data through the current
method and return it,
unchanged, within the
response.
```
```
ignoreInterruptions Boolean This may be used in some cases
to suppress logic applied by the
Web SDK, such as automatic
opening of screens (for
example, in a registration
completion scenario). This
parameter may not be used
with REST APIs.
```
```
httpStatusCodes Boolean The default value of this
parameter is false, which means
that the HTTP status code in
SAP Customer Data Cloud's
response is always 200 (OK),
even if an error occurs. The
error code and message is given
within the response data (see
below). If this parameter is set
to true, the HTTP status code in
SAP Customer Data Cloud's
response would reect an error,
if one occurred.
```
####  Note


## Authorization Parameters

Each REST API request must contain identication and authorization parameters.

Some REST APIs may function without these authorization parameters, however, when that occurs, these calls are treated as

client-side calls and all client-side rate limits will apply. In order to not reach client-side IP rate limits that may impact your

implementation when using server-to-server REST calls, it is Recommended Best Practice to always use an application key and

secret or a bearer token when sending requests. A non-exhaustive list of REST APIs that this may apply to are as follows:

```
accounts.login
```
```
socialize.login
```
```
accounts.notifyLogin
```
```
socialize.notifyLogin
```
```
accounts.nalizeRegistration
```
```
accounts.linkAccounts
```
Please refer to the Authorization Parameters section for details.

## Sample Requests

## accounts.search RegEx support REST

## Querying using Regular Expressions

Gigya supports searching using regular expressions. Note that RegEx search cannot be applied to encrypted elds. For a full list of

elds that are encrypted by default, see Encrypted Fields; in addition, elds may be encrypted by your site admin using the

schema editor.

## Description

The supported operations for searching using regular expressions are listed below.

When possible, you should try to use a long prex before your regular expression, as wide matching expressions (such as .*?+)

may be computationally intensive.

#### Anchoring

Patterns are always anchored. The pattern provided must match the entire string.

For string "abcde":

ab.* # match

abcd # no match

#### Reserved Characters

The following characters are reserved, and need to be escaped:

###### ?. + * | { } [ ] ( ) " \

Any reserved character can be escaped with a backslash.

For example: "\*", "\\".

###### {

```

],
"objectsCount": 1,
"totalCount": 2,
"statusCode": 200,
"errorCode": 0,
"statusReason": "OK",
"callId": "7651"
}
```
####  Note

```
regExp queries may lower performance in some cases.
```

#### Match any character

The period "." is used to represent any character.

For string "abcde":

ab... # match

a.c.e # match

#### Match One-or-more

The plus sign "+" can be used to repeat the preceding shortest pattern once or more times.

For string "aaabbb":

a+b+ # match

aa+bb+ # match

a+.+ # match

aa+bbb+ # no match

#### Match Zero-or-more

The asterisk "*" can be used to match the preceding shortest pattern zero-or-more times.

For string "aaabbb":

a*b* # match

a*b*c* # match

.*bbb.* # match

aaa*bbb* # match

#### Match Zero-or-one

The question mark "?" makes the preceding shortest pattern optional. It matches zero or one times.

For string "aaabbb":

aaa?bbb? # match

aaaa?bbbb? # match

.....?.? # match

aa?bb? # no match

#### Match Min-to-max

Curly brackets "{}" can be used to specify a minimum and (optionally) a maximum number of times the preceding shortest pattern

can repeat.


The allowed forms are:

{5} # repeat exactly 5 times

{2,5} # repeat at least twice and at most 5 times

{2,} # repeat at least twice

For string "aaabbb":

a{3}b{3} # match

a{2,4}b{2,4} # match

a{2,}b{2,} # match

.{3}.{3} # match

a{4}b{4} # no match

a{4,6}b{4,6} # no match

a{4,}b{4,} # no match

#### Grouping

Parentheses "()" can be used to form sub-patterns.

The quantity operators listed above operate on the shortest previous pattern, which can be a group.

For string "ababab":

(ab)+ # match

ab(ab)+ # match

(..)+ # match

(...)+ # no match

(ab)* # match

abab(ab)? # match

ab(ab)? # no match

(ab){3} # match

(ab){1,2} # no match

#### Alternation

The pipe symbol "|" acts as an OR operator. The match will succeed if the pattern on either the left-hand side OR the right-hand

side matches.

The alternation applies to the longest pattern, not the shortest.


For string "aabb":

aabb|bbaa # match

aacc|bb # no match

aa(cc|bb) # match

a+|b+ # no match

a+b+|b+a+ # match

a+(b|c)+ # match

#### Character classes

Ranges of potential characters may be represented as character classes by enclosing them in square brackets "[]". A leading ^

negates the character class.

The allowed forms are:

[abc] # 'a' or 'b' or 'c'

[a-c] # 'a' or 'b' or 'c'

[-abc] # '-' or 'a' or 'b' or 'c'

[abc\-] # '-' or 'a' or 'b' or 'c'

[^a-c] # any character except 'a' or 'b' or 'c'

Note that the dash "-" indicates a range of characters, unless it is the rst character or if it is escaped with a backslash.

For string "abcd":

ab[cd]+ # match

[a-d]+ # match

[^a-d]+ # no match

## accounts.setAccountInfo REST

This method sets account data into a user's account. The method accepts a list of optional parameters each dening a eld/object

in the account. The parameters that are passed in the request modify the relevant elds, and the other elds remain unchanged.

## Description

####  Caution

```
Do not use this API to create new elds within your site schema, use accounts.setSchema for consistent results. Fields created
with setAccountInfo have their write permissions automatically set to serverOnly, and must be manually changed using
accounts.setSchema to clientModify if you want to access these elds via client-side Web SDK calls.
```

The properties listed on this page apply to full accounts, note that Lite accounts only have access to a subset of these properties.

For detailed information on Lite Accounts, see the Lite Registration documentation.
